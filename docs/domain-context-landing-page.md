# RouteForce - Domain Context for Landing Page

## Product Overview

**RouteForce** is a modern delivery confirmation and order tracking system designed to streamline the package delivery verification process for businesses and their customers.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

Traditional delivery confirmation methods are unreliable and create friction:
- Drivers claim delivery but recipients never receive packages
- No automated proof of delivery confirmation from recipients
- Manual follow-ups waste time and resources
- Disputes over "delivered" vs "received" status
- Lack of audit trail for delivery confirmations

## How RouteForce Works

### For Business Users (Admin Portal)
1. Create delivery orders through intuitive admin interface
2. Enter recipient details (name, email, delivery address)
3. Select carrier/delivery service
4. System automatically generates secure confirmation tokens
5. Track delivery status in real-time dashboard

### For Recipients (Email-Based Confirmation)
1. Receive email notification when package is delivered
2. Click secure one-time confirmation link (no login required)
3. View delivery details and confirm receipt with single button click
4. System updates order status to "Delivered" instantly

### Security & Reliability
- Cryptographically secure one-time webhook tokens
